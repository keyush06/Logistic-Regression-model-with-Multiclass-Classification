 Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones database, which was built from the recordings of study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a smartphone with an embedded inertial sensors. 
 The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) performed.
